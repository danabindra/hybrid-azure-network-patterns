# NewCo Azure Cloud Network Architecture Documentation

## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** September 15, 2025  
**Author:** 
**Product:** Azure Cloud Network Platform  
**Project:** Greenfield Azure Network Deployment with Hybrid Integration  
**Status:** Draft for Review  
**Reviewers:** [TBD - e.g., NewCo Product Owners, Accenture Stakeholders]  
**Next Milestone:** Architecture Design Review (ADR) upon approval  

### 1. Introduction
**Product Overview:**  
This PRD defines the requirements for a secure, scalable Azure cloud network architecture to support NewCo's global operations. Drawing from Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) best practices, Accenture experiences, and Zero Trust principles (as outlined in the provided presentation), the product will enable a greenfield Azure deployment integrated with on-premises MPLS/SD-WAN networks. It centralizes security, ensures high availability across dual regions, and facilitates workload migration without disrupting existing infrastructure.

**Business Justification:**  
NewCo aims to modernize its hybrid cloud footprint for faster innovation, reduced latency, and enhanced security. This network platform will serve as the foundational "product" for all Azure-based services, supporting 100+ physical locations and cloud workloads.

**Scope:**  
- **In-Scope:** Hub-Spoke topology, connectivity (ExpressRoute/SD-WAN), security segmentation, IPAM, observability, and automation.  
- **Out-of-Scope:** Application-level development; on-premises hardware upgrades.

**Target Release:** Q4 2025 (Phase 1 MVP).

### 2. Objectives and Success Metrics
**Key Objectives:**  
- Provide centralized, Zero Trust-secured connectivity for hybrid workloads.  
- Achieve 99.99% uptime with dual-region HA.  
- Enable automated deployments reducing setup time by 50% via IaC.  
- Ensure compliance with NIST SP 800-207 and NewCo security policies.

**Success Metrics:**  
- Adoption: 80% of workloads migrated to spokes within 6 months.  
- Performance: <50ms inter-region latency; <1% traffic bypasses NVAs.  
- Security: Zero high-severity incidents in first year (tracked via Sentinel).  
- Cost: Stay under $10K/month for core infrastructure.

### 3. Stakeholders and User Personas
| Stakeholder | Role | Key Needs |
|-------------|------|-----------|
| NewCo Network Admins | Manage daily ops | Intuitive dashboards for monitoring/egress; automated failover. |
| Security Team | Enforce policies | Granular NVA controls; audit logs for all traffic. |
| Developers/App Owners | Deploy workloads | Self-service spoke provisioning; no direct peering complexity. |
| Accenture Consultants | Implementation | Terraform-compatible modules; integration guides for MPLS/SD-WAN. |

**Primary Persona:**  
- **Name:**  Sr. Cloud Engineer at NewCo.  
- **Goals:** Quickly provision secure VNets, monitor hybrid traffic, and troubleshoot egress issues.  
- **Pain Points:** Isolated networking pockets leading to security gaps; manual routing configs.

### 4. Functional Requirements
**Priority:** High (H), Medium (M), Low (L)  

| Req ID | Description | Priority | Acceptance Criteria |
|--------|-------------|----------|----------------------|
| FR-01 | Deploy Hub-Spoke Topology | H | Traditional Hub-Spoke with dual-region hubs (Central US primary, East US 2 secondary); VNet peering enforced; no direct spoke-to-spoke (PPT Page 5). |
| FR-02 | Centralized Security Transit | H | All traffic routes via NVAs (e.g., Check Point CloudGuard) for inspection/logging; UDRs force spoke-to-hub flows (PPT Page 7). |
| FR-03 | Hybrid Connectivity | H | ExpressRoute via Equinix CX for on-prem integration; Site-to-Site VPN as backup; SD-WAN overlay support (PPT Page 8). |
| FR-04 | Internet Egress Options | M | Configurable paths: Azure hub NVA (default), on-prem DWAN DIA, or AcmeCo DIA; NAT rules for outbound traffic (PPT Page 15). |
| FR-05 | Network Segmentation | H | Environment-based boundaries (Prod/Non-Prod); Azure Policy denies public IPs; TLS 1.3 enforcement (PPT Page 21). |
| FR-06 | IP Address Management | M | Azure Native IPAM with Infoblox API sync; automated allocations for greenfield spokes (PPT Page 30). |
| FR-07 | Observability and Monitoring | M | Hybrid dashboard (Prometheus/Grafana + Network Watcher); alerts for traffic anomalies; Sentinel integration (PPT Page 27). |
| FR-08 | Automation and IaC | H | Terraform modules for all components; CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions; policy-as-code for governance (PPT Page 27). |

### 5. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Support 10Gbps+ throughput per hub; <100ms failover time.  
- **Scalability:** Horizontal scaling for spokes (up to 500); auto-scale NVAs based on traffic.  
- **Security:** Zero Trust model – explicit allow/deny; encrypt all transit (L2 802.1Q VLANs where needed, PPT Page 34).  
- **Reliability:** Dual AZ per circuit; no single point of failure for FE/BE transit (PPT Page 28).  
- **Usability:** API-first for integrations; role-based access via Azure RBAC.  
- **Compliance:** Align with CAF/NIST; audit-ready logging for 90 days.  
- **Accessibility:** Standard Azure portal integration; no custom UIs required.

### 6. Assumptions, Dependencies, and Constraints
- **Assumptions (PPT Page 4):** Security from ground up; HA hub traffic; greenfield Azure; on-prem MPLS/SD-WAN integration.  
- **Dependencies:** Azure Subscription (Enterprise Agreement); Infoblox for IPAM; Check Point licenses for NVAs.  
- **Constraints:** Budget cap at $150K for Year 1; no new on-prem investments; vendor lock-in to Azure/Equinix.

### 7. Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Likelihood/Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------------|------------|
| Integration delays with on-prem | High/Medium | Pilot with single site; phased rollout. |
| Cost overruns from NVAs | Medium/High | Reserved instances; monitor via Azure Cost Management. |
| Skill gaps in team | Low/Medium | Training on Terraform/Zero Trust; Accenture support. |

### 8. Implementation Roadmap
- **Phase 1 (Q4 2025):** Core hub deployment, basic connectivity, security policies (MVP: FR-01, FR-02, FR-03).  
- **Phase 2 (Q1 2026):** Add spokes, IPAM, egress options (FR-04, FR-05, FR-06).  
- **Phase 3 (Q2 2026):** Full observability, automation, testing (FR-07, FR-08).  
- **Tools/Tech Stack:** Azure Portal/Terraform for deploy; Grafana for monitoring.

## Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

**ADR ID:** ADR-001  
**Title:** Adoption of Traditional Hub-Spoke Topology over Azure Virtual WAN  
**Date:** September 15, 2025  
**Author:** 
**Status:** Proposed → Accepted (upon PRD approval)  
**Supersedes:** None  
**Related ADRs:** ADR-002 (Egress Strategy)  
**Context:** As per the PRD (FR-01), NewCo requires a secure, hybrid-integrated Azure network enforcing Zero Trust. The topology must centralize NVAs for traffic inspection, support dual-region HA, and integrate with MPLS/SD-WAN without isolated pockets (PPT Pages 4, 5, 21).

**Decision:** Implement Traditional Hub-Spoke architecture:  
- Dual hubs (Central US primary, East US 2 secondary) with FE/BE VNets and NVAs.  
- Workload spokes peered to hubs; UDRs route all traffic via NVAs.  
- Reject Azure Virtual WAN for lacking NVA granularity.

**Rationale:**  
- Aligns with PRD security objectives (centralized control, drag-and-drop firewalls).  
- Enables explicit traffic flows (hub transit, no spoke-to-spoke – PPT Page 7).  
- **Alternatives:**  
  - Azure Virtual WAN: Simplified but insufficient for custom routing (PPT Page 5).  
  - Full Mesh: Scalability/visibility issues.  
- Evidence: CAF/NIST guidelines emphasize segmentation (PPT Page 28).

**Consequences:**  
- **Positive:** Scalable governance via management groups; full observability.  
- **Negative:** 20% higher ops overhead – offset by IaC (PRD FR-08).  
- **Risks:** Routing errors – Mitigated by policies/Network Watcher.  
- **Metrics:** 99.99% HA; <1% uninspected traffic.

**Enforcement:** Mandate in all Terraform deploys; revisit for IPAM (PRD FR-06).
