# Hybrid Azure Network Patterns

Enterprise-grade network architecture patterns for hybrid Azure deployments. Features multi-region security, SD-WAN integration, DNS optimization, and multi-cloud connectivity with NIST compliance validation.

##  Architecture Patterns

### Core Network Flows
- **[Branch-to-Azure Connectivity](patterns/branch-to-azure/)** - MPLS + ExpressRoute integration
- **[Internet Egress Architecture](patterns/internet-egress/)** - Centralized outbound security
- **[Internet Ingress via Front Door](patterns/internet-ingress/)** - Global load balancing with WAF
- **[Region-to-Region Transit](patterns/region-to-region/)** - Multi-region NVA security

### Advanced Integration
- **[Multi-Cloud Connectivity](patterns/multi-cloud-connectivity/)** - Equinix Cloud Exchange Fabric
- **[Hybrid DNS Strategy](patterns/dns-hybrid/)** - Azure Private DNS + On-premises

##  Key Features
- Zero Trust Architecture (NIST SP 800-207 aligned)
- Multi-region security with NVA transit points
- Automated DNS integration (Azure Private DNS + Infoblox)
- SD-WAN policy optimization for cloud traffic
- Enterprise compliance frameworks

##  Quick Start
1. Browse [architecture diagrams](diagrams/svg/) for visual overview
2. Review [implementation patterns](patterns/) for detailed designs
3. Use [configuration templates](configurations/) for deployment
4. Validate against [compliance frameworks](compliance/)

## Prerequisites
- Azure subscription with ExpressRoute connectivity
- Understanding of hub-spoke network topology
- Familiarity with Azure networking concepts
- Basic knowledge of SD-WAN and DNS concepts

## Enterprise Use Cases
- Large-scale Azure migrations requiring hybrid connectivity
- Multi-region disaster recovery implementations  
- Zero trust network architecture transformations
- Regulatory compliance in financial/healthcare sectors
- Multi-cloud integration strategies
