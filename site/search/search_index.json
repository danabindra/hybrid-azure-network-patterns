Introduction","text":"<p>Document Overview: This Architecture Requirements Document (ARD) specifies the architectural requirements for the AcmeCo Azure Cloud Network Platform. It builds on the PRD by detailing how the architecture must address functional and non-functional needs, ensuring alignment with Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) best practices, Accenture experiences, and Zero Trust principles from the provided presentation. The focus is on the structural, technical, and integration aspects to support a secure, scalable greenfield Azure deployment integrated with on-premises MPLS/SD-WAN.</p> <p>Purpose: To define mandatory architectural elements, constraints, and quality attributes that guide the design, implementation, and verification of the network architecture. This ensures the solution meets enterprise-scale demands for high availability, security, and hybrid connectivity.</p> <p>Scope: - In-Scope: Architectural patterns (e.g., Hub-Spoke), component specifications, integration points, performance benchmarks, and compliance requirements. - Out-of-Scope: High-level business requirements (covered in PRD); low-level code implementations.  </p> <p>Assumptions: - Greenfield Azure environment with no legacy dependencies beyond on-premises integration (PPT Page 4). - Access to Azure Enterprise Agreement and required vendor licenses (e.g., Check Point for NVAs).</p>"},{"location":"ARD/#2-architectural-objectives-and-principles","title":"2. Architectural Objectives and Principles","text":"<p>Core Objectives: - Enforce Zero Trust architecture with centralized security transit for all traffic flows. - Achieve high availability (HA) and disaster recovery (DR) across dual regions. - Support scalable hybrid connectivity while minimizing latency and costs. - Enable automation and observability for operational efficiency.</p> <p>Guiding Principles: - Security First: No isolated networking pockets; all traffic inspected via NVAs (PPT Page 4). - Modularity: Use subscription-based isolation (Core Infrastructure for hubs, Workloads for spokes \u2013 PPT Page 8). - Standardization: Align with CAF/NIST SP 800-207; leverage Azure-native services where possible (PPT Page 28). - Automation: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) via Terraform for reproducibility (PPT Page 27).</p> <p>Success Metrics: - Architectural Compliance: 100% adherence to Zero Trust flows (verified via audits). - Performance: 99.99% uptime; &lt;50ms inter-region latency. - Scalability: Handle 500+ spokes without redesign.</p>"},{"location":"ARD/#3-functional-architectural-requirements","title":"3. Functional Architectural Requirements","text":"<p>Priority: High (H), Medium (M), Low (L)  </p> Req ID Description Priority Architectural Details Acceptance Criteria AR-01 Hub-Spoke Topology Implementation H Traditional Hub-Spoke with dual-region hubs (Central US primary, East US 2 secondary); VNet peering and route tables for transit. Deployed hubs support FE/BE separation; peering enforced via ARM templates (PPT Page 5, ADR-001). AR-02 Centralized Security and Inspection H NVAs (e.g., Check Point CloudGuard) as transit points; UDRs route spoke traffic to NVAs for logging/policy enforcement. All inter-spoke and egress traffic inspected; no direct peering allowed (PPT Page 7, 21). AR-03 Hybrid Connectivity Architecture H ExpressRoute circuits via Equinix CX for diversity; Site-to-Site VPN as resilient backup; SD-WAN overlay integration. Dual AZ circuits per region; BGP for dynamic routing (PPT Page 8, 10). AR-04 Internet Egress Architecture M Modular egress paths: Azure hub NVA (primary), on-prem DWAN DIA, or AcmeCo DIA; NAT and firewall rules configurable. Support failover between options; integrate with threat intelligence (PPT Page 15). AR-05 Network Segmentation and Boundaries H Environment-specific VNets (Prod/Non-Prod); Azure Policy for private IP enforcement and TLS 1.3. Cross-environment traffic blocked; VLAN support via L2 802.1Q (PPT Page 21, 34). AR-06 IP Address Management (IPAM) M Azure Native IPAM as primary with Infoblox API sync for hybrid visibility; automated allocation scripts. Centralized dashboard; conflict detection for on-prem overlaps (PPT Page 30). AR-07 Observability Architecture M Hybrid monitoring stack: Prometheus/Grafana on AKS, Network Watcher, and Sentinel; end-to-end tracing. Real-time metrics for traffic flows; alerts for anomalies (PPT Page 27). AR-08 Automation and Governance H IaC with Terraform modules; management groups for RBAC; CI/CD pipelines for deployments. Policy-as-code for prevention; subversion workflows (PPT Page 27)."},{"location":"ARD/#4-non-functional-architectural-requirements","title":"4.
